3. What is Training set and Test set?

Training set is something we know the input and output values which we used to generated Machine Learning model. a training set is a dataset used to train a model. In training the model, specific features are picked out from the training set. These features are then incorporated into the model.

 The test set is a dataset used to measure how well the model performs at making predictions on that test set. Test set is used to test the accuracy of the hypotheses generated by the learner.
